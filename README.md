# CastleQuest | 2D RPG Game 

This project was created within the Programming In Java course at CTU university. The game is a straightforward 2D RPG game in which player becomes a hero lost in a castle, looking for a way out by discovering elements such as the map, keys and similar, while fighting against monsters.

The whole project included the design, development and testing of the application from the logic itself to the rendering. I personally included a special section "Game Hacking" where I was using various tools to search for different variables in the already running code.By changing them I was able to influence the behavior of the game itself.

Documentation for this project is not available in this repository but is being stored externally on my gitlab account where the entire workflow of the application development was performed.
